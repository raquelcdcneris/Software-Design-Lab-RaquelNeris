<p>I am a service designer and a learning experience designer. 
    I have worked in different industries designing digital products 
    and facilitating workshops to help organizations master design tools 
    for innovation. I am also the co-founder of Educar 3.0,

    students in Brazilian schools. Today, I work for the Borough 
    of Manhattan Community College as the OpenLab Student Engagement
